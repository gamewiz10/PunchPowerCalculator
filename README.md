# Punch Power Calculator

**Punch Power Calculator** is an Android app that calculates the power of your punch by analyzing the change in distance between two marked points on images of you striking a heavy bag. By providing your weight, the bag's weight, and specific punch parameters, the app estimates the force behind each punch.

## Features

- **Image-Based Punch Analysis**: Upload two images of yourself striking a heavy bag.
- **Dynamic Power Calculation**: Measure the change in distance between two green dots placed on the punch images.
- **Custom Input Fields**: Enter the weight of the bag, height of the dot placement, and your height and weight.
- **Accurate Force Estimation**: Analyze your punches with physics-based calculations.
