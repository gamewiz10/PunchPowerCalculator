# Punch Power Calculator

**Punch Power Calculator** is an Android app that calculates the power of your punch by analyzing the change in distance between two marked points on images of you striking a heavy bag. By providing your weight, the bag's weight, and specific punch parameters, the app estimates the force behind each punch.

## Features

- **Image-Based Punch Analysis**: Upload two images of yourself striking a heavy bag.
- **Dynamic Power Calculation**: Measure the change in distance between two green dots placed on the punch images.
- **Custom Input Fields**: Enter the weight of the bag, height of the dot placement, and your height and weight.
- **Accurate Force Estimation**: Analyze your punches with physics-based calculations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** (latest version recommended)
- **Java/Kotlin**: Ensure you have an updated version compatible with Android development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/punch-power-calculator.git
****
Usage
Launch the app and upload two images of yourself punching a heavy bag.
Place two green dots on both images to mark the position of your fist before and after impact.
Enter the following information:
Weight of the heavy bag (in kg or lbs)
Height of the dot placement (in cm or inches)
Your height and weight (for calculating relative punch power)
Tap "Calculate" to view the estimated punch force.

How It Works
The app calculates punch power based on the change in distance between two manually placed dots in the images, using the following steps:

Image Comparison: Analyzes the distance change between dots in the two images.
Force Calculation: Combines user inputs and distance data to estimate the force applied to the heavy bag.
